To Do: (priority,difficulty) (0-5,0-5)
IN PROGRESS:
- Cannot POST /error/report.html
- Check that everything works
- translation

FUNCTIONAL:
-(3,2) Fix the log file report so it counts 10s intervals correctly
-(3,1) Maybe make the ghost session thing automatic.
-(3,2) Maybe add a flag at the top of log files indicating the IDs of the user & trainer and the user's RS
-(3,5) Password Encryption
  - Note: it's https now, so that's half the battle
  - Maybe sometime ask for Name, BD, and sex, and convert those into a hash string like NiMH does. Then store each individual's data in the same file, even if they make a new account. 
-(2,2) ?Set up auto email response to reports? (probably not)
  - OR, add a place in the admin tab where you can write a reply to a comment and send it from something@tictrainer.com.
  - OR, mailto: link
  - Also probably have it send an email to KJB when a real comment comes in. (or weekly report so he's not swamped, though that's not likely right now)

VISUAL:
-(4,1) Add links to tictrainer.com from places like KJB website & tics-r.us
-(4,1) Make tweaks to homepage
-(4,2) Switch the session log option to a series of boxes: first type trainer ID, then type user ID, then it loads the dates or names of the files which have that combo of trainer and user. This should avoid the crazy list problem.
-(3,2) Add more things to store
  - I could add more decorations
  - Streak bonuses like duolingo
-(2,3) make better documentation
  - Comments, README.md, traditional documentation, paper

DEEPER: 
-(3,2) Sync functions are used a few places for editing. Determine if that's necessary and get rid of them.
-(2,4) ?use json? ajaj? instead of ajax and .tt*d and xml?
-(2,5) ?Convert everything in the session to redirects?
-(1,2) ?seperate reports and errors?
-(1,3) ?move more things to aux? (I've been doing this)
-(1,3) ?Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing? Meh, nah. But it should be harder to cheat.
-(1,5) Switch over to a better data storage system like MySQL. (If traffic gets crazy)

NOTES:
- Justify: Why do I do the session the way I do? Why require both user and trainer to link prior to sessions. Avoid bizarre typos? t0 types t0-u1 and u1 types u1-t0 *at the same time* *On accident* It's not really necessary, but it adds a level of insurance.
