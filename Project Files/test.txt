FUNCTIONAL:

- Use more fs.open ?: eliminate sync functions
- Convert everything in the session to 307 redirects?
- move more things to aux?
- Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing

MAYBE:
- add leaderboard
- look up dragonfable level up ratios
   - (100*level^2)http://dfwiki.com/w/Experience_Chart
   - http://epicduelwiki.com/w/Experience#Experience_by_Level
