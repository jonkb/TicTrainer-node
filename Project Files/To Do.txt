To Do:
FUNCTIONAL:
ARE WE READY TO GO PUBLIC?
- BEFORE WE DO:
  - Dad edit index paragraphs

VISUAL:

DEEPER:
- check form errors client-side
- Use more fs.open ?
- Convert everything in the session to 307 redirects
- get rid of birth date for trainers or check minimum age. Why is it there?
- move more things to aux?
- Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing

MAYBE:
- add leaderboard
- look up dragonfable level up ratios   - (100*level^2)http://dfwiki.com/w/Experience_Chart   - http://epicduelwiki.com/w/Experience#Experience_by_Level
- convert points into coins on each levelUp, add a store
  - buy decorations, stickers?
- Maybe use ajax instead for linkloading-trainer?
- use json? ajaj? instead of ajax and .data and xml
- move reports out of error and into report folders
