To Do: (priority,difficulty) (0-5,0-5)
IN PROGRESS:

FUNCTIONAL:
-(2,2) ?Set up auto email response to reports? (probably not)
  - OR, add a place in the admin tab where you can write a reply to a comment and send it from something@tictrainer.com.
  - OR, mailto: link
  - Also probably have it send an email to KJB when a real comment comes in. (or weekly report so he's not swamped, though that's not likely right now)
-(3,5) Password Encryption
  - Maybe sometime ask for Name, BD, and sex, and convert those into a hash string like NiMH does. Then store each individual's data in the same file, even if they make a new account. 
-(3,4) HTTPS

VISUAL:
-(4,1) Add links to tictrainer.com from places like KJB website & tics-r.us
-(3,2) Add more things to store
  - I could add more decorations
  - Streak bonuses like duolingo
-(2,3) make better documentation
  - Comments, README.md, traditional documentation, paper

DEEPER: 
-(3,2) Sync functions are used a few places for editing. Determine if that's necessary and get rid of them.
-(3,2) double check that all forms are checked on both sides
-(2,3) ?Maybe use ajax instead of form for linkloading-trainer?
-(2,4) ?use json? ajaj? instead of ajax and .data and xml?
-(2,5) ?Convert everything in the session to 307 redirects?
-(1,2) ?seperate reports and errors?
-(1,3) ?move more things to aux? (I've been doing this)
-(1,3) ?Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing?
-(1,5) Switch over to a better data storage system like MySQL. (If traffic gets crazy)

NOTES:
- Justify: Why do I do the session the way I do? Why require both user and trainer to link prior to sessions. Avoid bizarre typos? t0 types t0-u1 and u1 types u1-t0 *at the same time* *On accident* It's not really necessary, but it adds a level of insurance.
