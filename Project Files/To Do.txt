To Do:
FUNCTIONAL:
- The DNS thing.
- look up forever.js
- add report to session files. 
	- Total # of tics
	- # of 10s tic free intervals
	- Longest tic free interval
	- Start and end points
- fix onbeforeunload on mobile
- "I'm paying attention" widget for trainer

VISUAL:
- switch link and edit in manage account
- use btn in forms
- make it less natural to run away after ret_created
- change b,m counter size for screen size

DEEPER:
- get rid of birth date for trainers or check minimum age. Why is it there?
- switch things to real files
	- switch the ret_* functions to reading in a file and inserting the data in the holes (like font program template)
- Use normalize.css ?
- Stylesheet MIME type mystery
- use fs.open instead of writeFileSync
- Think about moving things to an external js file
- Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing

MAYBE:
- add leaderboard
- make id's non-case sensitive ? what about hex? or base 36? or not 4-long
- Maybe use ajax instead for linkloading?
- use json? ajaj?
