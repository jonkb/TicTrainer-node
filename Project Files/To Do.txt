To Do:
IN PROGRESS:
- Checking everything still works
- Fix Leaderboard Sort

FUNCTIONAL:
- Add store for coins
  - buy decorations, stickers
- ?Set up email response to reports?

VISUAL:
- ?add leaderboard?
- ?meh Make order obvious and implicit (Reg > Man > Ses) ? (/index.html)

DEEPER:
- finish aux.editData
- double check that all forms are checked on both sides
- ?Convert everything in the session to 307 redirects?
- Use more fs.open ?: eliminate sync functions 
- ?move more things to aux?
- ?Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing?
- ?Maybe use ajax instead of form for linkloading-trainer?
- ?use json? ajaj? instead of ajax and .data and xml?
- ?move reports out of error and into report folder?
- ?Make a backdoor where I can request(edit?) a data file by adding identification to the body of an html request.

NOTES:
- Justify: Why do I do the session the way I do? Why require both user and trainer to link prior to sessions. Avoid bizarre typos? t0 types t0-u1 and u1 types u1-t0 *at the same time* *On accident* It's not really necessary, but it adds a level of insurance.
