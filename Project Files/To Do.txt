To Do:
IN PROGRESS:
- Checking everything still works

FUNCTIONAL:
- Add store for coins
  - buy decorations, stickers
- Justify: Why do I do the session the way I do? Why require both user and trainer to link prior to sessions. Avoid bizarre typos? t0 types t0-u1 and u1 types u1-t0 *at the same time* *On accident* It's not really necessary, but it adds a level of insurance.

VISUAL:
- Add an error page for fe, se

DEEPER:
- make sure all forms are checked on both sides

MAYBE:
- Use more fs.open ?: eliminate sync functions
- Convert everything in the session to 307 redirects?
- move more things to aux?
- Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing
- add leaderboard
- Maybe use ajax instead of form for linkloading-trainer
- use json? ajaj? instead of ajax and .data and xml
- move reports out of error and into report folder
- ? Make order obvious and implicit (Reg > Man > Ses) ? (/index.html)
- Make a backdoor where I can request a data file by adding identification to the body of an html request.
