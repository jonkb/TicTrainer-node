To Do:
IN PROGRESS:
- Checking everything still works
  - session_end-user saving l,p

FUNCTIONAL:
- Register

ARE WE READY TO GO PUBLIC?
- BEFORE WE DO:
  - Dad edit home paragraphs
- Bug Report: name& email optional
- get rid of birth date for trainers or check minimum age. Why is it there?
  - trainer year
  - user + random
  - change "edit account" to "change password"

VISUAL:
- "Note 4: After the person saves the form on which it asks their birth month and year, I'd like the server to respond with a (non-editable) reply like this: "Great. FYI, the fake birthdate we will use for you is [June 13, 1999 -- whatever we actually just saved]. There's a small chance (less than 3%) that it is your real birthday, but if so, that's just a lucky guess. All we know on our end is that it's within a couple of months of your real birthday."
[FYI: http://bit.ly/290iX3G -- and the likelihood is even lower if the person was born on a day other than the 15th.] "

- Add a dynh page for fe, se
DEEPER:
- check form errors client-side
- Use more fs.open ?: eliminate sync functions
- Convert everything in the session to 307 redirects?
- move more things to aux?
- Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing

MAYBE:
- add leaderboard
- look up dragonfable level up ratios
   - (100*level^2)http://dfwiki.com/w/Experience_Chart
   - http://epicduelwiki.com/w/Experience#Experience_by_Level
- convert points into coins on each levelUp, add a store
  - buy decorations, stickers?
- Maybe use ajax instead for linkloading-trainer?
- use json? ajaj? instead of ajax and .data and xml
- move reports out of error and into report folder
