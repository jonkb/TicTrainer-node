To Do:
IN PROGRESS:
- Checking everything still works

FUNCTIONAL:
- Fix 10s tic free interval counter in report

VISUAL:
- Add a dynh page for fe, se

DEEPER:
- check form errors client-side
- Use more fs.open ?: eliminate sync functions
- Convert everything in the session to 307 redirects?
- move more things to aux?
- Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing

MAYBE:
- add leaderboard
- look up dragonfable level up ratios
   - (100*level^2)http://dfwiki.com/w/Experience_Chart
   - http://epicduelwiki.com/w/Experience#Experience_by_Level
- convert points into coins on each levelUp, add a store
  - buy decorations, stickers
- Maybe use ajax instead for linkloading-trainer
- use json? ajaj? instead of ajax and .data and xml
- move reports out of error and into report folder
- ? Make order obvious and implicit (Reg > Man > Ses) ? (/index.html)
