To Do:
FUNCTIONAL:
- The DNS thing. - PURL - aws elastic ip address - aws route 53?
- look up forever.js - ex. forever -l forever.log -o out.log -e err.log my-script.js - that or "nohup" - or multiplexer - or disown
  - $ nohup node server.js &> ../"Project Files"/log.txt
- fix onbeforeunload on mobile

VISUAL:
- change b,m counter size for screen size

DEEPER:
- get rid of birth date for trainers or check minimum age. Why is it there?
- switch things to real files
- Use normalize.css ?
- use fs.open instead of writeFileSync
- Think about moving things to an external js file
- Should I make it check password each step of the session for safety -- would that be taxing

MAYBE:
- add leaderboard
- make id's non-case sensitive ? what about hex? or base 36? or not 4-long
- Maybe use ajax instead for linkloading-trainer?
- use json? ajaj?
