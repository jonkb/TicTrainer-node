			<h2>Is there a privacy risk involved with using TicTrainer&trade;?</h2>
			
			<p>
				No. TicTrainer™ never asks you for your name or any other personal information, so 
				there is no privacy risk. (We do ask for the month and year the user was born in, 
				but to protect privacy, we don’t even save that! Rather, we save a fake birthdate 
				randomly chosen within a few months of the month you tell us.) We will use the 
				anonymous data to try to learn something about how well TicTrainer™ works, who it 
				works best for, and how to improve it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that because privacy is so important to us, we do not save your passwords. 
				That means if a user loses his or her password, we can’t help you and you’ll have to 
				create a new account, losing past progress.
			</p>
