certbot-auto is depricated, so use 
$ sudo certbot certonly --force-renewal -d tictrainer.com -d www.tictrainer.com --standalone --cert-name tictrainer.com --preferred-challenges http

I tried for a long time to get the --webroot option to work so it would update while running the server, but it keeps coming back with an error, and I didn't find any cases online of people with the same issue. I think I'm basically ready to give up on --webroot and stick with standalone. There's a good way to do it though, with --pre-hook and --post-hook, so it's all in one command. Though for that to work, I need runTT.sh working.
This is the command I used last:
sudo /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto certonly --force-renewal -d tictrainer.com -d www.tictrainer.com --standalone --cert-name tictrainer.com --preferred-challenges http
That's because I also reinstalled certbot, and the path is different...
USE THIS SCRIPT: ~/util_scripts/renew_cert.sh
I tested it and it works! It renews the cert for you.

22 Oct 2019 - I edited the sudo cron to run the line we know works every other month.
/etc/letsencrypt/certbot-auto --force-renewal -d tictrainer.com -d www.tictrainer.com --standalone certonly --preferred-challenges http


The preferred way to update the certificates is to run 
  sudo /etc/letsencrypt/certbot-auto renew
on a scheduled basis e.g. cron 

But that command needs to connect via port 443 (HTTPS), so it
doesn't work while TicTrainer.com is running (on that same port).

There's probably a good solution but I don't know what it is.
Perhaps running the certificate renewal on a different computer, then
scp'ing the files to this server?

The certificates expire every 90 days or so, so this will not be
a one-time fix.

OK, this worked today:
* stop TicTrainer node.js server
* sudo /etc/letsencrypt/certbot-auto --force-renewal -d tictrainer.com -d www.tictrainer.com --standalone certonly --preferred-challenges http

Probably it can be automated?
