##Notes
* The old job that ran every 5 minutes was checking if the IP address ever changed.
In practice, the IP changed once (As shown in /tmp/freedns_tictrainer_mooo_com.log) over the several years that it was running. So, I'll set it up to check twice a day this time.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html Says when the public IP changes
* I'm not using certbot-auto anymore since it's depricated. See cert_renewal_info.txt
* See https://crontab.guru/ for a nifty tool
