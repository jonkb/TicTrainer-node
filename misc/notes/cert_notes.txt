BTW, don't move certbot-auto. It's used there by a cron task.

What I did (see https branch on github) (see also https://certbot.eff.org/#pip-other):
1. Download certbot-auto
	Certbot with yum - https://dade2.net/kb/how-to-install-and-configure-certbot-on-apache-centos/
2. Get a certificate by running $ sudo certbot certonly --force-renewal -d tictrainer.com -d www.tictrainer.com --standalone --cert-name tictrainer.com --preferred-challenges http
	Not sure how that works
3. Switch to the https node module and add the paths for the cert and key to an options object
4. Set up the renewal cron job


Used to be a comment in server.js
	/*Open with options object.

		This directory contains your keys and certificates.

		`privkey.pem`  : the private key for your certificate.
		`fullchain.pem`: the certificate file used in most server software.
		`chain.pem`    : used for OCSP stapling in Nginx >=1.3.7.
		`cert.pem`     : will break many server configurations, and should not be used
	                 without reading further documentation (see link below).

		We recommend not moving these files. For more information, see the Certbot
		User Guide at https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#where-are-my-certificates.
