      <h2>Welcome to TicTrainer</h2>
      <p>
				The TicTrainer&#8482; software aims to treat Tourette's syndrome through RE-ERP 
				(Reward-Enhanced Exposure and Response Prevention). Essentially, this means trying not to tic for 
				as long as possible, with rewards for long periods without a tic. All user data is kept anonymous, 
				but may be used for research by <a href="http://www.nil.wustl.edu/labs/kevin/">Kevin Black, MD</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>How to use TicTrainer</h2>
			<p>
				First, trainer and user both <a href="register/">register</a> an account. 
				Then, each goes to <a href="account.html">Manage Account</a> to link to the other.
				Then, you can <a href="session/">start a session</a> from two devices. 
				The user will see a counter with their points and the current rate they recieve points, 
				and the trainer will see two buttons. The trainer must carefully watch the user and press the 
				"Tic Detected" button when the user tics. When the training session is over, press "End Session"
				and the user's points and level will be saved.
