      <h2 style='margin-top:0;'>How to use TicTrainer&#8482;</h2>
 
	<p>
				<i>At the moment, Microsoft&reg; browsers (Internet Explorer and Edge) 
				don't display TicTrainer&#8482; correctly. Try another browser.</i> 
	    		</p>	

	    		<p>TicTrainer&trade; only works when a “user” (a person with tics) and a “trainer” 
				(<i>e.g.</i> a parent, a psychologist or a physician) are logged on at the same time. 
				Each has a separate account and password. During training, each is watching a
				separate browser window, so usually 
				they log in on different devices (<i>e.g.</i>, Johnny at a computer and 
				Mom on her smart phone). However, it is possible to log in the 
				user and the trainer on two separate browser windows on the same 
				computer. Please follow the detailed instructions in the table below.
				The user has to follow the instructions on the left, and the trainer the 
				instructions on the right.

					<h3>4. What the user does during a training session.</h3> 
					The screen shows a big number (like 3292, below) and a smaller number 
					(like +36). The big number shows how many points you have earned on 
					the current level. The smaller number is the reward rate, showing how 
					fast you are earning points. The longer you go without a tic, the 
					higher that number gets, and the faster you earn points. Every time 
					you tic, the screen flashes red, and the smaller number resets to 
					zero, but you keep the points you have earned.
					<img src="media/score_sample.PNG" alt="score (sample)" style="width:125px;height:43px;">
					<p>Below these numbers your current level is shown. At higher levels, 
					you have to go longer between tics to get points, but you get more 
					points. When you qualify for the next level, the screen flashes green. 
					Your points reset to zero for the new level, but you also earn “coins” 
					that track your long-term progress.</p>

					<h3>4. What the trainer does during a training session.</h3> 
					Every time you see or hear a tic, click on the “Tic Detected” button.
					If a long time passes between tics, the program will think you aren’t 
					paying attention, and will end the training session early. To prevent 
					this, click on the “I’m here” button before the timer bar reaches the 
					right edge. <br> 
					<img src="media/Slide15.PNG" alt="3 trainer buttons during session"> <br>
					Continue the session for the pre-arranged duration (<i>e.g.</i> 15 
					minutes), then click the “End Session” button. You can also use the 
					“End Session” button to end the session early if you need to; this 
					will save the user’s points and level.
